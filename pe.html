<h4>Blues in E</h4>
Standing on the corner
Suitcase is in my hand
Jack is in his corset, and Jane is in her vest
I'm in a rock 'n' roll band

Ridin' in a Stutz bear cat, Jim
Those were different times
The poets they studied rules of verse
And those ladies rolled their eyes

You know you sweet Jane
Oh now baby, sweet Jane
Oh yes sweet Jane

Now Jack, he is a banker
And Jane, baby she is a clerk
And both of them save their money honey
When they come home from work

Sittin' there by the fire
The radio does play the classical music there, kid
The march of the wooden soldiers
And you can, you can hear Jack say

You know he saying, "Sweet Jane
Ooh baby, sweet Jane
Ah yes sweet Jane"

Some people like to go out dancing
Whereas other people like us got to work
Gotta watch me now and there's even some evil mothers
They'll tell you life's just dirt

That the pretty women never really faint
That villains always blink their eyes
That children are the only ones who blush
And that life, life is just to die, but I want to tell you something

Anyone who has ever had a heart
Oh oh wouldn't turn around and break it half
Anyone who has ever played a part
They're not gonna turn around and hate it

You know they're singin', "Sweet Jane
Ah sweet Jane
Ooh sweet Jane"

Sweet Jane
Sweet Jane
Sweet Jane
Sweet Jane
Sweet Jane
Sweet Jane
Sweet, sweet, sweet Jane

<h4>Old Time Rock and Roll</h4>
Just take those old records [F#] off the shelf
I’ll sit and listen to ’em [B] by myself
Today’s music ain’t [C#] got the same soul
I like that old time [F#] rock and roll

Don’t try to take me to a [F#] disco
You’ll never even get me [B] out on the floor
In 10 minutes I’ll be [C#] leavin’ for the door
I like that old time [F#] rock and roll [C#]

Still like that old time [F#] rock and roll
That kind of music just [B] soothes the soul
I reminisce about the [C#] days of old
with that old time [F#] rock and roll [C#]
F#    F#    B    B   C#    C#    F#    C#

Won’t go to hear ’em play a [F#] tango
I’d rather hear some blues or [B] funky old soul
There’s only one sure way to [C#] get me to go
Start playing old time [F#] rock and roll
 
Call me a relic, call me [F#] what you will
Say I’m old-fashioned, say I’m [B] over the hill
Today’s music ain’t [C#] got the same soul
I like that old time [F#] rock and roll [C#] 
 
Still like that old time [F#] rock and roll
That kind of music just [B] soothes the soul
I reminisce about the [C#] days of old
with that old time [F#] rock and roll  [C#]
F#    F#    B    B   C#    C#    F#    C#
 
Still like that old time [F#] rock and roll
That kind of music just [B] soothes the soul
I reminisce about the [C#] days of old
with that old time [F#] rock and roll [C#]
                         N.C.
Still like that old time rock and roll
That kind of music just soothes the soul
I reminisce about the days of old
with that old time rock and roll
 
Still like that old time [F#] rock and roll
That kind of music just [B] soothes the soul
I reminisce about the [C#] days of old
with that old time [F#] rock and roll [C#]

<h4>Down On The Corner</h4>
Early in the evenin' just about supper time
Over by the courthouse they're starting to unwind
Four kids on the corner trying to bring you up
Willy picks a tune out and he blows it on the harp

[Chorus:]
Down on the corner, out in the street
Willy and the Poorboys are playin'
Bring a nickel; tap your feet

Rooster hits the washboard and people just got to smile
Blinky, thumps the gut bass and solos for a while
Poorboy twangs the rhythm out on his kalamazoo
Willy goes into a dance and doubles on kazoo

[Chorus]
[Chorus]

You don't need a penny just to hang around
But if you've got a nickel, won't you lay your money down?
Over on the corner there's a happy noise
People come from all around to watch the magic boy

<h4>Long Train Runnin</h4>
[Gm7] Down around the corner, half a mile from here
See them long trains run, and you watch them disappear
 
Without [Cm7] love, where would you be [Gm7] now
Without [Eb] lo--  [Dsus4]  o-- [D] --o- [Gm7] ove

[Gm7] You know I saw miss Lucy down along the tracks
She lost her home and her family and she won't be coming back
 
Without [Cm7] love, where would you be [Gm7] now
Without [Eb] lo--  [Dsus4]  o-- [D] --o- [Gm7] ove

[Gm7] Well the Illinois Central, And the Southern Central Freight
Got to keep on pushin' mama, You know they're running late
 
Without [Cm7] love, where would you be [Gm7] now
Without [Eb] lo--  [Dsus4]  o-- [D] --o- [Gm7] ove
 
Gm7    Cm7 Gm7  Eb Dsus4 D Gm7
  
[Gm7] Well the Illinois Central, And the Southern Central Freight
Got to keep on pushin' mama, You know they're running late
 
Without [Cm7] love, where would you be [Gm7] now
Without [Eb] lo--  [Dsus4]  o-- [D] --o- [Gm7] ove
 
[Gm7] Well the pistons keep on turning [F] and the [Gm7] wheels go round and round [F]
The [Gm7] steel rails are cold and hard [F] For the [Gm7] miles that they go down
 
Without [Cm7] love, where would you be [Gm7] now
Without [Eb] lo--  [Dsus4]  o-- [D] --o- [Gm7] ove
 
[Cm7] ooh, Where would you be now

<h4>Mary Janes Last Dance</h4>
She grew up in an Indiana town
Had a good-lookin' mama who never was around
But she grew up tall and she grew up right
With them Indiana boys on them Indiana nights

Well, she moved down here the age of eighteen
She blew the boys away, it was more than they'd seen
I was introduced and we both started groovin'
She said, "I dig you baby, but I got to keep movin' on
Keep movin' on"

Last dance with Mary Jane, one more time to kill the pain
I feel summer creepin' in and I'm tired of this town again

Well, I don't know, but I've been told
You never slow down, you never grow old
I'm tired of screwin' up, tired of going down
Tired of myself, tired of this town

Oh, my my, oh, hell yes
Honey, put on that party dress
Buy me a drink, sing me a song
Take me as I come 'cause I can't stay long

Last dance with Mary Jane, one more time to kill the pain
I feel summer creepin' in and I'm tired of this town again

There's pigeons down on Market Square
She's standin' in her underwear
Lookin' down from a hotel room
The nightfall will be comin' soon

Oh, my my, oh, hell yes.
You got to put on that party dress
It was too cold to cry when I woke up alone
I hit my last number, I walked to the road

Last dance with Mary Jane, one more time to kill the pain
I feel summer creepin' in and I'm tired of this town again

<h4>The Jack</h4>
She gave me the Queen
She gave me the King
She was wheelin' and dealin'
Just doin' her thing
She was holdin' a pair
But I had to try
Her Deuce was wild
But my Ace was high
But how was I to know
That she'd been dealt with before
Said she'd never had a Full House
But I should have known
From the tattoo on her left leg
And the garter on her right
She'd have the card to bring me down
If she played it right

She's got the jack, she's got the jack
She's got the jack, she's got the jack
She's got the jack, she's got the jack
She's got the jack, she's got the jack
She's got the jack, jack, jack, jack, jack, jack, jack
She's got the jack

Poker face was her name
Poker face was her nature
Poker straight was her game
If she knew she could get you
She played 'em fast
And she played 'em hard
She could close her eyes
And feel every card
But how was I to know
That she'd been shuffled before
Said she'd never had a Royal Flush
But I should have known
That all the cards were comin'
From the bottom of the pack
And if I'd known what she was dealin' out
I'd have dealt it back

She's got the jack, she's got the jack
She's got the jack, and who knows what else?
She's got the jack, yeah, yeah
She's got the jack, she's got the jack
She's got the jack, she's got the jack
She's got the jack, jack, jack, jack, jack, jack, jack
She's got the jack

She's got the jack, she's got the jack,
Ooh, It was a bad deal, (Jack)
She gave me the (Jack), hey
She's got the (Jack), she's got the (Jack)
She's got the (Jack), ooh can't you tell
She's got the (Jack, jack, jack, jack, jack, jack, jack, jack)

She's got the jack
She's got the jack, and it hurts!

She's got the jack, jack, jack, jack, jack, jack, jack
She's got the jack
Aaaaaah!

Thank you, thank you, thank you people, thank you, thank you
I'm glad you like the show, yes, thank you very much folks.
Goodnight and God bless!

<h4>Sharp Dressed Man</h4>

Clean shirt, new shoes
And I don't know where I am goin' to
Silk suit, black tie
I don't need a reason why

They come runnin' just as fast as they can
'Cause every girl's crazy 'bout a sharp dressed man

Gold watch, diamond ring
I ain't missin' not a single thing
And cuff links, stick pin
When I step out I'm gonna do you in

They come runnin' just as fast as they can
'Cause every girl's crazy 'bout a sharp dressed man

Top coat, top hat
I don't worry 'cause my wallet's fat
Black shades, white gloves
Lookin' sharp and lookin' for love

They come runnin' just as fast as they can
'Cause every girl's crazy 'bout a sharp dressed man

<h4>La Grange</h4>
Rumor spreadin' 'round in that Texas town
About that shack outside La Grange
And you know what I'm talkin' about
Just let me know if you wanna go
To that home out on the range
They gotta lotta nice girls
Have mercy
A-haw haw haw-haw
Heh, a-haw haw haw

Well, I hear it's fine if you got the time
And the ten to get yourself in
A hmm, hmm
And I hear it's tight most every night
But now I might be mistaken
Hmm, hmm, hmm
Have mercy

<h4>Love my horse</h4>
Love my horse, yes i do.
Love my horse, more than you.
Sun beats down, dust kicks up.
I have another shot, from my coffee cup.

Love my horse, big grey mare
Love my horse, drinking beer.
Sun beats down, kicks my ass.
Take a big swig, from my homebrew glass.

Love my horse, every day
Love my horse, every way.
Sun beats down, dust kicks up.
I have another shot, from my whisky cup.
